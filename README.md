# Task-Manager_App
Express is one of the most popular web frameworks for node.js. It is built on top of node.js http module, and adds support for routing, middleware, view system etc.
It is very simple and minimal, unlike other frameworks that try do way to much, thereby reducing the flexibility for developers to have their own design choices. 
In this Repo, i'll be building a simple Task-manage application , Rest APIs for creating, listing, editing and deleting a Task.
first start by building a simple web server and then move on to configuring the database, building the Note model and different routes for handling all the CRUD operations.
Finally, we’ll test our REST APIs using Postman.

Also, In this repo, we’ll heavily use ES6 features like let, const, arrow functions, promises etc. It’s good to familiarize yourself with these features. 
I recommend this re-introduction to Javascript to brush up these concepts. Well! Now that we know what we are going to build, We need a cool name for our application. 
Let’s call our application Howgerts-API's
